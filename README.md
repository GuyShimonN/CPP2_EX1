for run the progrem you need to use g++ compiler and run the following command:

1. **Clone the Repository**: First, you need to clone the repository to your local machine. Open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GuyShimonN/CPP2_EX1.git
```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Change your current directory to the project directory:

```bash
cd CPP2_EX1
```

3. **Build the Project**: According to the `README.md` file, you can build the project using the `make` command:

```bash
make
```

4. **Run the Tests**: If you want to run the tests, you can use the following commands:

```bash
make test
./test
```

5. **Clean the Project**: If you want to clean the project (remove all the build files), you can use the following command:

```bash
make clean
```

6. **Run the Tidy Test**: If you want to run the tidy test, you can use the following command:

```bash
make tidy
```

7. **Run the Valgrind Test**: If you want to run the valgrind test, you can use the following command:

```bash
make valgrind
```

That project deals with graph algorithms. Here's a brief overview of the functions in the code:

1. `bool Algorithms::tryColorGraph(const Graph &grp, std::vector<int> &colorArr)`: This function tries to color a graph using two colors (represented by 1 and 0) in such a way that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. This is a common approach to check if a graph is bipartite. If the graph can be colored in this way, it is bipartite and the function returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

2. `std::string Algorithms::buildBipartiteResult(const std::vector<int>& colorArr)`: This function takes the color array (which represents the coloring of the graph) and builds a string that represents the two sets of vertices in the bipartite graph.

3. `std::string Algorithms::isBipartite(const Graph &grp)`: This function checks if a given graph is bipartite. It uses the `tryColorGraph` function to try to color the graph and then uses `buildBipartiteResult` to build the result string.

4. `std::vector<size_t> Algorithms::traceCycle(const std::vector<size_t> &parent, size_t start)`: This function traces a cycle in the graph, given a 'parent' array (which represents the parent of each vertex in the graph) and a start vertex. It returns the cycle as a vector of vertices.

5. `std::string Algorithms::formatCycle(const std::vector<size_t> &cycle)`: This function takes a cycle (represented as a vector of vertices) and formats it as a string.

6. `std::string Algorithms::detectAndConstructCycle(const Graph &grp, const std::vector<int> &dist, const std::vector<size_t> &parent)`: This function detects a negative cycle in the graph and constructs it using the `traceCycle` and `formatCycle` functions.

7. `std::string Algorithms::negativeCycle(const Graph &grp)`: This function checks for a negative cycle in the graph. It uses the Bellman-Ford algorithm to relax the edges of the graph and then uses `detectAndConstructCycle` to detect and construct the negative cycle.

The code uses several data structures like vectors and queues, and it also uses concepts like graph theory and algorithms like DFS (Depth-First Search) and the Bellman-Ford algorithm.
